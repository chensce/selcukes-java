  [...]
</dependencies>

<h1>Video Screen Recorder:</h1>
Automatically saves a video recording if the test fails. Another great way to see what was the cause of test failure is to watch a video of the whole test execution. Since only the visible part of the screen can be recorded, video recording can be combined with the scroll to visible feature. If it is enabled in the configuration, before performing an action on an element, Selcukes scrolls until the element is visible on the screen.
Another enhancement of the videos is the highlighting of elements. Before each action, the element is highlighted, which makes it easier to spot later in the videos. 

<h1>Test Result Notifications:</h1>
Currently we moved to On premises environments. To view HTML report generated by automation scripts we need to connect to the different bank VPNâ€™s to open the report and check the related screenshots to see which test case has failed and why.
So, why not raise an alert as soon as the test case fails? And why not attach a screenshot along with that alert so that all the stakeholders can actually see what has failed in the application?
