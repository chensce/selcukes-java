errors:
  no_such_element_exception: |
    * Wrong locator might be used
    Make sure that you are using a unique locator.
    * The web page was not completely loaded and the element is not found
    you can use Selenium explicit waits, and wait until the element can be found on the page.
  element_not_visible_exception: |
    * Locator might finds more elements and the first one is not visible
    Make sure that you are using a unique locator.
    * The element is hidden
    If your locator is good, then you can add a wait, that checks when the element is visible.
  stale_element_reference_exception: |
    * The element was either deleted from the DOM or no longer attached to the DOM.
    Try to find the element after page refresh
    Add explicit wait for the element to load before you manipulate
  timeout_exception: |
    * This exception will be thrown when the page or element was not loaded after the specified wait time.
    To overcome this, you can increase the wait time, if you are using an implicit wait, or better yet, replace the implicit wait with an explicit wait
